# CPalms-Spammer-Server
Spam like/dislike requests to a [CPalms](https://www.cpalms.org/public/search/Resource) resource (assignment).

## Explanation
CPalms is a website for school assignments that I did not like. Fortunately, you can dislike the assignments.
There used to be assignments with hundreds of thousands of likes, but thanks to this simple program, many assignments got into the negative hundreds of thousands of likes.
Unfortunately they reset the like count on all the resources. This might not work anymore.


There are 2 versions.

* Server: use server resources to send requests (much more efficient, easily spam multiple CPalms resources)
* [Client](https://github.com/7ih/CPalms-Spammer-Client/): use client device resources to send requests (easier to set up)

## How it works
Just spams a post request to the dislike url.

## How to set up

1. Download this repository's contents where you want to run it (like a hosting platform, or your device)
2. Run index.js
3. Open public/index.html in a browser

## How to use

### type

First, choose request type. 
* Like: increases like count
* Dislike: decreases like count

### interval

Then, choose spam interval. This is the time between requests in milliseconds. Minimum time is 200.

### resource id

Then, select a CPalms resource to spam.
* Example link: https://www.cpalms.org/PreviewResourceStudentTutorial/Preview/185847

The program then extracts the resource's ID (the numbers at the end of the link) and uses it to send a request to a URL that affects the like count.

### buttons

There are then two buttons:
* GO: starts spamming requests with the current resource ID
* STOP: stops spamming requests with the current resource ID
